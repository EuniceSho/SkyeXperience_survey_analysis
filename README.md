## Back Story
This project was i was given to me for an interview i did 2022. I was to complete the cleaning, analyzing and visualization using ExcelðŸ˜² (not SPSS) in 2hrs which i hadn't worked on before thenðŸ˜”. Your guess is as good as mine, i didn't get the job. Handling a survey data is wey different from other dataset cleaning because some questions comes with multiple answers. Which can be frustrating for someone coming across it for the first time which was what i experienced during that interview-Project. So this is is me taking on this project heads on ðŸ˜Ž and adding it to my portfolio.

## Data Transformation
Power BI was used for the data cleaning and Visualization. 
1. To clean a survey data each multiple question has to be on separate tables for the data analysis to be possible using unpivot. 
2. I cleaned my data by promoting header, removing unneeded columns in each table, renamed Columns and also create custom colunms for several columns for example the Demography Age in this visual to make visualizing age on my dashboard in age order not in ascending order.
