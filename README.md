# Data Transformation
Power BI was used for the data cleaning and Visualization. 
1. To clean a survey data each multiple question has to be on separate tables for the data analysis to be possible using unpivot. 
2. I cleaned my data by promoting header, removing unneeded columns in each table, renamed Columns and also create custom colunms for several columns for example the Demography Age in this visual to make visualizing age on my dashboard in age order not in ascending order.
